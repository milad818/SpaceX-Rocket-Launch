# SpaceX-Rocket-Launch

In this course, we assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process, follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting our results to stakeholders.  

We are tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. With the help of our Data Science findings and models, the competing startup we have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
